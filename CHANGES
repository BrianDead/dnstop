    Added 'c' to display options. This screen will combine the
    source and sld fields to show "who is querying for what" -
    reason: we see alot of duplicate querys for whatever reason.
    This will help separate the legitimate queries from the broken
    resolvers, etc. See http://www.circleid.com/article/102_0_1_0_C/
    for more about that.
